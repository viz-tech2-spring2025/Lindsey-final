					Tropical cyclones are among the most powerful and destructive forces on Earth. Forming over warm
					ocean
					waters, these storms—known as hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones depending on the region—bring
					intense
					winds, torrential rains, and devastating storm surges. Over the past century, their frequency and
					intensity have been rising, leaving a lasting impact on coastal communities worldwide.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					This project explores the evolving story of tropical cyclones: how their activity has increased over
					time, how they affect people across the globe, and how communities respond in the face of disaster.
					Use
					the following visualizations to explore the history of these devastating storms and the resilience
					that
					emerges in their aftermath.

				<h3>What is a hurricane?</h3>
				<p>What you call a hurricane way depend on where you are in the world. Here in the Atlantic Basin, along
					with folks in the Northeastern Pacific Basin, we call them ‘Hurricanes’. But, if we were anywhere in
					the Indian Basins or the Australian/Southwest Pacific basin we would call them ‘Cyclones’. Finally,
					the term ‘Typhoon’ is reserved for those who live in the Northwest Pacific Basin.</p>

			<div class="step" data-step="1">
				<h3>That’s some strong wind!</h3>
				<p>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating system based on a hurricane's sustained
					wind speed, used to estimate potential property damage and flooding, with Category 3 and higher
					storms considered major hurricanes. </p>

			<div class="step" data-step="2">
				<h3>Great Cyclone of 1970</h3>
				<h4 style="color: red"; >Cat 4 <br>130 mph</h4>
				<p>The storm originated from a tropical depression that formed in the southern Bay of Bengal. From ship
					reports, the IMD it was estimated that the maximum sustained winds were near 130 mph (205 km/hr).

				<h3>Storm Surge</h3>
				<p>Storm surge is an abnormal water level rise generated by a storm over and above the predicted
					astronomical tide. Storm tide is the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the
					astronomical tide.</p>
				<p>Storm surge during Hurricane Katrina (2005) reached 25 to 28 feet along the Mississippi Coast, one of
					the highest storm surges ever recorded in the US.</p>

					<h3>Impact on Humans</h3>
					<p>Hurricanes can cause serious harm to humans, including loss of life, injury, and displacement. Their strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges often lead to flooding and damage to homes and infrastructure. They also disrupt communities and services, leaving lasting emotional and economic impacts.</p>

				<h3>Hurricane Seasons</h3>
				<p>Hurricane seasons refer to the times of year when tropical storms are most likely to form in certain regions. In the Atlantic, the season runs from June 1 to November 30, while the Eastern Pacific season starts earlier, from May 15 to November 30. In the Southern Hemisphere, such as around Australia, the cyclone season typically spans November to April. These seasonal differences are due to variations in ocean temperatures, wind patterns, and the Earth's tilt, which affect where and when conditions are right for hurricanes, cyclones, or typhoons to develop.</p>
